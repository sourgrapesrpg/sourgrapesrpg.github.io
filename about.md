# Why on Earth would anyone decide to make a pen-and-paper role playing game that is open source and in a zine format?

Some people kept them in a locked glass chamber while others threw them away. 

Look at the pictures, color in the titles, make drawings in the margins, edit the story to their own liking, give it to friends, turn them into paper airplanes or read it just to have a laugh at the poor writing. It was entirely up to you.

Zines are a crazy conglomeration of ideas that could never be mass produced. They exist in a world before everything was recorded and digitzed. They wrinkled, ripped, got coffee stained, the ink wore off in your hands, the stories faded into the paper until nothing remained.

And the stories were wild. They crossed genres, they blended fictional constructs, they took ideas and mutated them. 

They broke worlds.

This system exists to provide a starting point for some and paper airplanes for others. It's here to have a laugh or just be blank pages for your own doodles.
