## Story One - The Haunted Dorm
The adventure is 1980s horror themed. We will be looking at three situations that use the primary rolls found in sour grapes (Spend, Check and Situation)

### Part 1 | The Hallway of Terrors!
> The party of college students have managed to break through into the long abandoned dormatory where their friend has just gone missing. There is a scream and their only flashlight goes out. You can see some light from an outside streetlamp shining in the room at the opposite end of the hallway.
- Storyteller: Well?
- Jake: My character is going to continue down the hallway and try and find a light along the wall
- Storyteller: What's your character's Current Resolve?
- Jake: Two!
- Storyteller: Yeah, no. You barely can keep from leaping out the window you came in through. In fact, all of you spend a point of Resolve just to stay in spot.
- Ben: That puts me down to one.
- Storyteller: You are shaking in your boots.
- Sarah: My Resolve is now at five, so I'm fine. I tell everyone to calm down and try to get us down the hallway.
- Storyteller: That can work, spend a point of Prestige as well and that should be enough to get them moving. What do you do?
- Sarah: I turn around to the party and say "Hey, look, pull yourselves together..."

In this situation the story is progressed by spending stat points. There was no rolls made. However since these characters are in a tough situation they wont be getting these Stat points back right away. The Resolve they all lost wont come back until they get out of the abandoned dorm or learn more about what is going on.



### Part 2 | The Surprise
> Continuing from Part 1. The party enters the room at the end of the hallway. The room is dimly lit from a streetlamp outside. When the party enters in the room they hear a rustling noise from above. Then something leaps down at Ben.
- Storyteller: Ben make an Agility check roll, difficulty of 4 to get out of the way.
- Ben: My Agility is 4 exactly, so no matter what I'm going to fail, can I use any skill?
- Storyteller: What do you want to use?
- Ben: Photography?
- Storyteller: No.
- Ben: Camping? As in, survival instincts? 
- Storyteller: That seems almost reasonable. OK fine.
- Ben: My Camping skill is 2, I'm going to roll all of my Agility
`1,4,1,6`
- Storyteller: Ouch. Looks like the thing knocks you down. It doesn't hurt you but you lose another point of Resolve.
- Ben: That puts me to zero Resolve.
- Storyteller: OK so you're panicking and your resovle is injured. You break out into a dead run screaming.
- Ben: AAAAHHHH! I run back to where we came in
- Sarah: I get ready to attack the thing.
- Storyteller: It meows at you. It's your missing friend's cat.

In this part of the story Ben needed to pass a check roll but failed, this caused him to lose a point of Resolve from the cat scaring him. Since his Resolve hit zero he went into a panick.

### Part 3 | Ben?
> Now Ben is missing.
- Storyteller: Well, now what?
- Jake: We need to go find Ben
- Storyteller: OK well he just took off and it's pitch black in all the other rooms so how do you want to do this? 
- Sarah: Let's fix the flashlight
- Storyteller: Great idea, you find out that it just needs a little bit of tightening and it comes back on.
- Sarah: Do we see anything that indicates where he might have left? Any dust on the ground that's been disturbed?
- Storyteller: That sounds like a Perception check, any Skill to use?
- Jake: My character is majoring in Forensics, how about that?
- Storyteller: OK sure, difficulty of 3
- Jake: I just use up my Forensics Skill of 2 and I'll roll all my Perception (4)
`2,3,4,2`
- Jake: Six total. The two points of Forensic plus 4 successes in Perception
- Storyteller: Jake you scan the area and notice that one of the doors is opened but you thought it was closed when you came in here. Also you can see clouds of dust hitting the flashlight from that area as if it was recently forced open.

The party couldn't just go find Ben without doing some work ahead of time. This is a good example of a Situation roll. As the party performed actions such as fixing the flashlight the situation became easier until it was finally just a standard check roll to find Ben.
