### Situation 1 | The Hallway of Terrors!
> The adventure is 1980s horror themed. The party of college students have managed to break through into the long abandoned dormatory where their friend has just gone missing. There is a scream and their only flashlight goes out. You can see some light from an outside streetlamp shining in the room at the opposite end of the hallway.
- Storyteller: Well?
- Jake: My character is going to continue down the hallway and try and find a light along the wall
- Storyteller: What's your character's Current Resolve?
- Jake: Two!
- Storyteller: Yeah, no. You barely can keep from leaping out the window you came in through. In fact, all of you spend a point of resolve just to stay in spot.
- Ben: That puts me down to one.
- Sarah: My Resolve is now at five, so I'm fine. I tell everyone to calm down and try to get us down the hallway.
- Storyteller: That can work, spend a point of Prestige as well and that should be enough to get them moving. What do you do?
- Sarah: I turn around to the party and say "Hey, look, pull yourselves together..."

In this situation the story is progressed by spending stat points. There was no rolls made. However since these characters are in a tough situation they wont be getting these Stat points back right away. The Resolve they all lost wont come back until they get out of the abandoned dorm or learn more about what is going on.
